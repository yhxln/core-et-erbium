(for ET Erbium)

## Architecture Freeze - DV Plan

## Mission

Verify functional correctness\, robustness\, and compliance before tape\-out

## Verification Strategy



* Methodology:
  * Directed testing
  * Constrained randoms to uncover corner cases\, unexpected interactions and boost confidence in the design
* Testbench Architecture:
  * Re\-use and improve
    * Erbium and ET\-SoC\-1 testbenches
    * Copper SOC testbench
    * MRAM testbench
  * Develop
    * ET\-Link to AXI4 bridge testbench
    * Periph testbench \( QSPI\, xSPI\, I2C\, UART\)
* Regression and automation:
  * B4C \(Github CI\) to validate new changes \(subset of tests\)
  * Weekly regression to measure overall progress and readiness \(full test suite\)

## DV Testbenches - EVL



* EVL includes many checking mechanisms:

  * Will require porting shire build tests to the neigh build
  * Re\-use ET\-SoC\-1 coverage to measure how thoroughly the design has been tested against its specifications\.


## DV Testbenches - ETL2AXI



* Why a new testbench?
  * __New development:__  Bridge will be implemented largely from scratch → initial verification confidence is low
  * __Critical component:__   <span style="color:#26221f">Any malfunction could stall cores\, block transactions\, corrupt data\, and isolate the Minions from the outside the Neigh world</span>
  * __Verification approach:__  Build a lightweight yet comprehensive testbench to ensure robustness and reliability while enabling faster turnaround
* Checking mechanisms:
  * Bus protocol \(ET\-Link and AXI4\) scoreboards
  * ET\-Link to AXI4 translation scoreboards
  * Assertion based protocol checks
* Stimulus:
  * Random bus requests injected directly into the RTL bridge bus interface
  * Error injection and back pressure knobs


## DV Testbenches - CocoTB



* Full Chip verification scope:
  * Verify data flow and connectivity between Minions\, MRAM\, interconnects and peripherals
  * Verify system\-level interactions like interrupts and IO devices
  * Test the real bootrom in the RTL
  * Verify top level pad connections
* Co\-simulation:
  * Integrate sysemu co\-simulation in CocoTB \(very nice to have\)
* Stimulus:
  * <span style="color:#ff0000">TODO \- Tests? </span>  _[Verification\_Plan\.xlsx](XXX)_
  * <span style="color:#ff0000">TODO \- Coverage?</span>

  * __AXI protocol checking:__  checks the AXI2MRAM bridge for adherence to the underlying protocol\.
  * __Debug interface checking:__  ensures that all test registers are accessible and have their desired functionality
* Checking Mechanism:
  * ???

  * Directed Testing
  * Directed Random

    * Pin toggle covered will be considered for integration verification completeness
  * RAL Tests will not contribute to coverage for any environment \(unit\, system\,soc\)


## DV Testbenches - Validation

Validation on Alveo U250

## DV Co-Simulation



* Use  _sysemu_  to handle the co\-simulation in RTL
  * Source code:  _[aifoundry\-org/et\-platform](https://github.com/aifoundry-org/et-platform)_
* How co\-simulation works?
  * Every time a Minion commits an instruction\, its architectural state is captured
  * During test execution\, the captured architectural state is continuously compared against the golden model \(sysemu\)
* Example of co\-simulation checks :
  * Ensure that RTL does not violate software program order
  * Check memory consistency order
  * Verify memory data correctness


## Constrained Randoms



* Corner\-case bugs are often difficult to anticipate and even more challenging to reproduce reliably\.
* Some ET\-SoC\-1 show\-stopper bugs that would have been missed by directed tests:
  * Thread 1 starves Thread 0 to complete a Tensor Store
  * DCACHE replay\_queue and buffer\_array entry counters may not discount allocated entries \(credit/counter leaking\) when gsc and regular operations overlap
  * TensorReduce stalls both threads 0 and 1 from executing VPU instructions ends up in deadlock
* For ET\-SoC\-1 we used STING \(commercial\, Synopsys\)\, but for post\-silicon we developed an in\-house random test generator named MTG\.
* __Proposal:__  revive MTG to fill the gap and boost confidence in the design
* MTG is written in Python\, does not require a license and is highly configurable
* Source code:  _[nekkoai/dv](https://github.com/nekkoai/dv/tree/main/mtg)_


## Verification Flows

__RTL Simulation: __ Validates functionality at a high level with zero\-delay models\.

__Gate\-Level Simulation:__  Runs on the synthesized netlist\, supporting either zero\-delay \(for faster simulation\) or real timing delays \(closer to silicon behavior\)

__X\-Propagation:__  Model unknown values \(X\) realistically\, ensuring simulation reflects real silicon behavior

__Power\-Aware verification \(UPF\):__  validates power intent across domains

__Emulation \(FPGA\):__  Run the design on hardware to accelerate verification and enable early software testing

## DV tools



* __Primary toolset:__  Synopsys tools \(commercial\)
  * Verilator is currently not supported but it is something we should explore in the future
* Key functions:
  * Simulation \(VCS\) for block\-level and full\-chip tests
  * Coverage analysis and closure tracking
  * Debug environment for waveform and log analysis
* Licenses requirement:
  * For CI \(B4C\):  <span style="color:#ff0000">TBD</span>
    * \# of ET Tests: 134
    * Total time assuming one license
  * For Regressions:  <span style="color:#ff0000">TBD</span>
    * \# of Erbium tests:  <span style="color:#ff0000">\(?\)</span>
    * \# of ET tests: 1529
    * Total time assuming one license
