# QSPI Datasheet

\Begin{multicols}{2}

The Quad SPI is an improved version of SPI with multiple IO lines i.e. QSPI supports dual as well as Quad IO lines support. (Better performance compared to legacy SPI). The QSPI also comes with the Execute in Place option which avoids copying the code to the On chip memory and executing. The core can directly read from flash and execute. i.e. the QSPI flash chips can act like normal RAM to the core.

The QSPI implementation also has programmable address size, data size, dummy cycle, instruction size, etc. The IO lines as well as the QSPI clock are all software configurable.

## Features

* Supports Single/dual/Quad SPI mode.
* Single / Double Data rate support.
* Supports 3 modes
    * Indirect mode (All operations are performed using QSPI registers).
    * Automatic status polling mode (flash status register is periodically read and interrupt is generated on flag setting).
    * Memory mapped mode (XiP mode): flash memory is mapped into device address space and seen as internal memory.
* Programmable for Single SPI (Legacy SPI), Dual IO mode & Quad IO mode.
* Programmable widths for Address, data, dummy cycles, instruction, alternative mode, etc.
* Common 32 byte FIFO is shared across both transmit & receive.
* Status register & interrupt enable registers.
* Programmable flash size.
* Mode 0 and mode 3 support.

## QSPI registers

The original register IP sizes are variable for the Shakti use cases, and the data duplicates it across for the access size. Although logically 32-bit or less on the IP side, they are accessible as 64-bit values on the system bus.

| 31:0 | DATA[31:0] | **Data**: Data to be sent/received to/from the external SPI device.<br>In indirect write mode, data written to this register is stored on the FIFO before it is sent to the flash memory during the data phase.

If the FIFO does not have as many bytes as requested by the read operation and if BUSY=1, the read operation is stalled until enough data is present or until the transfer is complete, whichever happens first.<br>In automatic status-polling mode, this register contains the last data read from the flash memory (without masking).<br>Word, halfword, and byte accesses to this register are supported. In indirect write mode, a byte write adds 1 byte to the FIFO, a halfword write 2, and a word write 4. Similarly, in indirect read mode, a byte read removes 1 byte from the FIFO, a halfword read 2, and a word read 4.<br>Accesses in indirect mode must be aligned to the bottom of this register: a byte read must read DATA[7:0] and a halfword read must read DATA[15:0]. |

## Features Tested

* Single/Quad SPI mode.
* indirect mode (All operations are performed using QSPI registers).

## Program Flow

### Initialization
1.  **Enable Peripheral**: Write to the `SystemConfig` register in the System Control block to enable the QSPI clock and interface (`qspi_enable = 1`).
2.  **Configure Flash Parameters (optional)**: Write to the `DEVICE_CONFIG_REG (DCR)` to set the flash memory size (`FSIZE`) and clock mode (`CKMODE`).
3.  **Enable Controller**: Write to `CONTROL_REG (CR)` to set the clock prescaler and enable the controller (`QSPI_ENABLE = 1`).

### Indirect Write Transaction
1.  **Set Data Length**: Write the number of bytes to be transferred to the `DATA_LENGTH_REG (DLR)`.
2.  **Configure Transaction**: Write to the `COMMN_CONFIG_REG (CCR)` to specify the instruction, address mode, data mode, and dummy cycles. Set `FMODE = 00` (Indirect Write).
3.  **Set Address**: Write the target flash address to the `ADDRESS_REG (AR)`. This prepares the controller for the start of the transaction.
4.  **Provide Data**: Write the data to be transmitted into the `DATA_REG (DR)`. For multiple words, ensure the FIFO has space by checking `FLEVEL` in `STATUS_REG`. For write transcation to start the fifo must be filled with minimum of 4 bytes of data.
5.  **Wait for Completion**: Monitor `STATUS_REG[1]` (`TCF` - Transfer Complete Flag). Once set, the transaction is finished.
6.  **Clear Flags**: Write `1` to `FLAG_CLEAR_REG[1]` (`CTCF`) to clear the transfer complete flag for the next operation.

**Example: Quad Page Program (Instruction 0x32)**
*   Target: Write 4 bytes to address `0x000000`.
*   `DLR = 0x00000003` (4 bytes).
*   `CCR = 0x03002532` (imode=1, admode=1, adsize=2, dmode=3, fmode=0, instr=0x32).
*   `AR = 0x00000000`.
*   `DR = 0xDEADBEEF`.

### Indirect Read Transaction
1.  **Set Data Length**: Write the number of bytes to be read to the `DATA_LENGTH_REG (DLR)`.
2.  **Configure Transaction**: Write to the `COMMN_CONFIG_REG (CCR)` with `FMODE = 01` (Indirect Read) and relevant phase modes.
3.  **Trigger Transaction**: Write the source flash address to the `ADDRESS_REG (AR)`. The controller will automatically start fetching data.
4.  **Read Data**: Monitor `STATUS_REG[13:8]` (`FLEVEL`) or `STATUS_REG[2]` (`FTF`). Read the received data from the `DATA_REG (DR)`.
5.  **Wrap Up**: Wait for `TCF` to be set, then clear the flag via `FLAG_CLEAR_REG`.

**Example: Quad Fast Read (Instruction 0xEB)**
*   Target: Read 4 bytes from address `0x001000`.
*   `DLR = 0x00000003` (4 bytes).
*   `CCR = 0x07182CEB` (imode=1, admode=3, adsize=2, dmode=3, fmode=1, dcyc=6, instr=0xEB).
*   `AR = 0x00001000`.
*   Read `DR` once `FTF` or `TCF` is set.
