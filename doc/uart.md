# UART Datasheet

The UART module provides a two-wire asynchronous serial non-return-to-zero (NRZ) communication with RS-232 (RS-422/485) interface. Each UART module has transmit and receive buffers that can hold up to 16 entries. Data transfer rate can be modified by providing appropriate value to the UARTBAUD register.

**Required data rate = Internal clock frequency / (UARTBAUD * 16)**

The data transmission and reception starts with a start bit followed by data words whose length can be varied through UARTCHARSIZE in UARTCONTROL register which is followed by optional parity bit and stop bits. The parity can be Odd or Even and the parity can also be disabled through UARTPARITY bits in the UARTCONTROL register. The number of stop bits can also be varied through UARTSTOPBITS in the UARTCONTROL register. Delayed Transmit control is done by providing the required delay in the UARTTXDELAY register.

The value to be transmitted is written into the UARTTXDATA register and the value received is read from the UARTRXDATA register. UARTSTATUS register holds the UART status & UARTINTERRUPTEN register holds the interrupt enable for the various interrupt events. UARTRXTH register holds the receiver FIFO threshold value, when the RX FIFO level increases beyond the threshold, corresponding status bit will be set and when interrupt is enabled, interrupt will be raised. UART can be operated in full-duplex or half-duplex mode. The inputs to UART receiver and transmitter are double-buffered and each has its own separate enable and interrupt bits.

UART has three external pins - Transmitter data pin, Receiver data pin and Transmitter output enable pin.

## UART Registers

The original register IP sizes are variable for the Shakti use cases, and the data duplicates it across for the access size. Although logically 32-bit or less on the IP side, they are accessible as 64-bit values on the system bus.

## Program Flow

### Initialization
1.  **Global Enable**: Enable the UART peripheral in the `SystemConfig` register (set `uart_enable = 1`).
2.  **Baud Rate**: Set the `BaudReg` with the calculated divisor for the desired baud rate.
3.  **Line Coding**: Configure `ControlReg` for the required character size (e.g., 8-bit), parity (None/Odd/Even), and stop bits (1, 1.5, or 2).

### Data Transmission
1.  **Check Status**: Read `StatusReg` and verify that `tx_full` (bit 1) is `0` or `tx_empty` (bit 0) is `1`.
2.  **Write Data**: Write the 8-bit or 32-bit data word to the `TxReg`.
3.  **Wait for Done**: (Optional) Poll `StatusReg[0]` to ensure the transmitter has finished sending all bits if consecutive high-speed writes are not being used.

### Data Reception
1.  **Monitor Status**: Poll `StatusReg[2]` (`rx_notEmpty`) to check if data has been received and stored in the RX FIFO.
2.  **Read Data**: Read the received word from the `RxReg`.
3.  **Error Checking**: After reading, check `StatusReg` bits [7:4] for any `break_error`, `frame_error`, `overrun_error`, or `parity_error` that might have occurred during the reception.

### Interrupt

The interrupt mechanism consists of 3 registers, Interrupt Raw, Interrupt Mask and Interrupt Status,

* InterruptStatus is a readonly register and contains the result of anding the Raw and Mask registers. The interrupt generated from uart is teh OR reduce of all bits of interruptStatus. 
* InterruptStatus is a stick bit set when the corresponding interrupt condition occurs and stays set until it is cleared by the software. Clearing of interrupt is done by writing the current value of the corresponding status bit back to that bit. i.e.
* Writing a 1 to a cleared status bit sets the interrupt, this can be used to test the interrupt behavior during S/W development/debug.

| Current Value | Write Value | Result  |
| ---           | ---         | ---     |
| 0             | 0           | cleared |
| 1             | 1           | set     |
| 1             | 0           | set     |
| 0             | 1           | set     |
